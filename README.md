This project is a Weather Dashboard that allows users to search for weather information by city or country name. Upon entering a city or country name, the application provides current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) and a brief description of the current weather.

The application fetches real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API. It is deployed on two web servers with a load balancer (HAProxy) distributing traffic evenly between them.
